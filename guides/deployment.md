## Deployment (TODO)

Currently done through fabric. The plan is to create an elixir CLI that can
replace fabric, but for now â€” fabric it is.

Configure `./fabfile.py` with your own values.

Ensure that `@version "0.X.0"` is set as module attribute in your `mix.exs` file.

Run

    $ fab prod bootstrap_release

to deploy on your production box.

To build a new release

    $ fab prod build_release

To build and deploy a new release

    $ fab prod deploy_release

To seed your DB:

    $ fab prod seed

To dump local db to .sql

    $ fab dump_localdb

To upload local db to remote

    $ fab prod upload_db

To load remote db

    $ fab prod load_db

To dump/upload/load local db to remote:

    $ fab prod dump_and_load_db

To upload your local `media/` folder (only runs if remote `media/` doesn't exists!)

    $ fab prod upload_media

To upload your local `etc/` folder

    $ fab prod upload_etc
